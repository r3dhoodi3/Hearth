-- =============================================================================
-- Hearth - one live lead per relationship (0060)
-- RUN THIS AGAINST THE LIVE DATABASE (Supabase SQL editor); editing repo SQL
-- alone does NOT change the already-deployed database. Idempotent and safe to
-- re-run.
--
-- Marketplace integrity rule: a pro who already has an ACTIVE job with a
-- homeowner (assigned to them, not yet closed or lost) may not apply to
-- ANOTHER open job from that SAME homeowner in the SAME category. They
-- already have the homeowner in Messages, so a second apply fee would
-- double-charge the pro for a relationship they already bought, and the
-- homeowner would see a paid "application" from someone they're mid-job with.
--
-- Boundaries, each deliberate:
--  - Once the earlier job is closed (won) or lost, applying again is ALLOWED.
--    Rehires are the highest-value loop and must never be blocked.
--  - A different category with the same homeowner is always allowed.
--  - A different homeowner is always allowed.
--
-- "Same homeowner" is the property owner (properties.user_id), the same
-- identity rehire_pro (0030) uses for prior-hire history. "Active" matches
-- the pro dashboard's own definition: any assigned lead whose status is not
-- closed/lost.
--
-- The app checks this rule first (src/app/pro/actions.ts applyToJobAction,
-- friendly flash, and the board card swaps Apply for "Message them instead"),
-- but apply_to_lead is executable by authenticated directly, so the function
-- is the hard backstop. The exception text 'Already working with this
-- homeowner' is matched by the server action's error mapping; keep them in
-- sync.
--
-- Everything else below is 0058's apply_to_lead verbatim (aging fee, FOR
-- UPDATE serialization, 3-spot cap, grant-sum-capped bonus). Signature is
-- unchanged, so CREATE OR REPLACE preserves the existing EXECUTE grant to
-- authenticated.
